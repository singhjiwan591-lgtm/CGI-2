# Next.js Project Deployment Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to run and deploy this Next.js application.

## Running the Development Server

To run the application locally for development, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, typically on [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002).

## Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the creator of Next.js and provides a seamless hosting experience.

1.  **Push Your Code to GitHub**: Make sure your latest code is pushed to a GitHub repository.

2.  **Sign Up for Vercel**: Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/) and sign up for a free account using your GitHub profile.

3.  **Import Your Project**:
    *   From your Vercel dashboard, click "Add New... > Project".
    *   Select your GitHub repository from the list. Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project.

4.  **Deploy**: You can accept the default settings and click the "Deploy" button.

Vercel will then build and deploy your application, providing you with a public URL once it's finished.
